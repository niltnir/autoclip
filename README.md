# Autoclip

Autoclip is a rusty, old program I wrote and gave away for free.

It is based on the tool
[*jumpcutter*](https://github.com/carykh/jumpcutter) that Cary K. Huang wrote and
demonstrated in one of his YouTube videos. I re-engineered a simple Windows
desktop version in Java.

Demos were made for the tool in Japanese by [Hideki Goya](https://okimath.com).
[Here](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=AIcyNUiSj-4) is the video explaining
installation and usage, and [here](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=XK35WThF9oo) is a
video edited using Autoclip.

Unfortunately, despite the demo above, the project is currently unmaintained,
archived, and dead. A build might still work under newer environments, but if
the API calls to ffmpeg have changed, there's a high chance that it will not
function properly under new versions.

Be warned, the source is probably way uglier than you think (I was still pretty
new to hacking back then).
